    <h2> BackRub </h2>
    <p>
      Page and Brin met at Stanford University in 1995, where both were doctoral students in the computer science program. In 1996, Larry Page began working on a research project, it was a search engine called “Back Rub” with the help of Sergey Brin with the aim of classifying websites into a group of importance by using their back link data and using it as a criteria to display engine results. This basically means to rank information on the web by the popularity of links, where a page with more backlinks which are links that point from other websites to your website  would rank higher.

    <h2> PageRank </h2>
    <ul>
      <li> In 1998, they developed the PageRank algorithm which was the foundation for google. </li>
      <li> It’s a system that’s used to rank websites in their search engine results page. </li>
      <li> 
        It determined the relevance of the website by the number of pages and the importance of pages that linked back to the original website.
      </li>
      <li> Their goal was to improve the way computer users search for information on the internet by organizing and presenting the information that is available to them efficiently.
      </li>

    <h2> The Creation of Google </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The project BackRub was renamed Google. </li>
      <li>It was derived from the misspelling of the word googol (a mathematical term for the number 1 followed by 100 zeros).” </li>
      <li>
        To further their search engine, they raised  $1 million from investors and close ones, and officially incorporated Google on September 4, 1998.
      </li>
      <li> Google has since become the world's most popular search engine, receiving an average of 5.9 billion searches per day in 2013. </li>
      <li>
        Google's search engine fundamentally changed how we find and consume information. It brought knowledge to our fingertips and democratized access to the vast expanse of the internet. Whether it's answering a trivia question, finding directions, or researching a topic, Google has become an indispensable part of our lives.
