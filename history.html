        Page and Brin met at Stanford University in 1995, where both were doctoral students in the computer science program. In 1996, Larry Page began working on a research project, it was a search engine called “Back Rub” with the help of Sergey Brin with the aim of classifying websites into a group of importance by using their back link data and using it as a criteria to display engine results. This basically means to rank information on the web by the popularity of links, where a page with more backlinks which are links that point from other websites to your website  would rank higher.
